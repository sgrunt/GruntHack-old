  cursor keys don't escape from a text entry prompt,
  no longer crashes in a 20- or 21-line window.
* VS2008 compilation fix, from the NetHack dev team

Bug fixes:
* Wishes related to dragon scale mail and some magical items originating
  in vanilla now parse correctly.
* Some behaviour related to re-enabled deferred features (such as merging
  with shimmering dragon scale mail upon being polymorph) is now active.
* The vorpal jabberwock's beheading attack now works properly.
* Monsters attacking other monsters with sickness attacks now has the
  expected effect.
* Sting now generates hit messages, and grants warning against orcs only
  (as opposed to any monster capable of being generated as an orc).
* Off-hand magical weapons now generate the correct message if attacking
  a target immune to their special ability.
* Killing a monster polymorphed into an engulfing form from within is now
  handled slightly better (messages are more logically ordered and no
  impossible() message is generated).
* A racial monster's displaced image now displays with the correct colour
  if showrace is enabled.
* A missing piece of code preventing dgamelaunch simplemail from working
  was added back in.
* Non-artifact weapons with extra damage properties used against the
  player now correctly check for the appropriate resistance on the
  player's part.
* Erroneous display of "Your <x> rusts!" and other forms of erosion
  when items carried by monsters erode, and related crashes, no longer
  occur.
* Ball and chain now behave properly when eroding away.
* Long worms once again display correctly, and a related crash was fixed.
* Monsters switching between ranged and melee weapons is handled slightly
  better (previously, they would frequently try to bash you with their
  ranged weapon).
* Monster reading a non-blessed scroll of remove curse now behaves properly.

Dungeon-related:
* Some additional Sokoban levels are present.
* You now can obtain one of three rewards from Sokoban. (Whether this is
  random or not depends on how clever you are.)
* Yeenoghu, Geryon, Dispater, and Demogorgon now have their own fortresses
  in Gehennom. Gehennom has been extended by five levels to allow room
  for this.

Player-related:
* Attempting to call a high priest on the Astral Plane no longer results
  in unrealistic penalties, merely less information than is presented
  in vanilla.
* Several new spells, such as the monster-inspired "touch of death" and
  "psi bolt" and the deferred "flame sphere" and "freeze sphere".
* Casting a spell successfully adds 50-149 turns until the spell is
  forgotten; without casting a spell at all, it is now forgotten in
  10000 turns instead of 20000.
* When prompted for a direction, entering an invalid direction will now
  prompt the player again for a direction; cancelling requires the player
  to press Esc.
* The travel command now finds dungeon features (most notably stairs) even
  if an item is on top of them.

Monster-related:
* The beholder's remaining gaze attacks have been implemented; thus the
  beholder has been enabled.
* There are now queens and ladies in addition to kings and lords. (Suggested
  by ishanyx in #nethack.)
* Player monsters now have a chance of being randomly generated in the
  dungeon, and will carry level-appropriate equipment.
* Monster spellcasting has been overhauled - monsters will now cast spells
  from the pool of player spells, instead of their own unique spells.
  (This behaviour is optional and controlled by #define COMBINED_SPELLS
   in config.h.)
* Monsters can now use some additional items (wands and containers
  particularly).
* If you throw an intelligent pet an item that they are capable of using,
  they will catch the item and (if applicable) use it immediately.
* Grudge-bearing monsters are now more likely to attack their targets.
* Conversely, covetous monsters are less likely to target other monsters
  if they do not have an objective in sight.
* Bumping into a peaceful monster while invisible no longer angers it.
* Monsters (and you!) can now be buried in the same manner as objects.

Object-related:
* Objects can now be invisible, with many associated side effects.
  (Some cues for this were taken from the Extended Invisible Objects patch
   by Nephi, but the implementation is entirely original.)
* Exploding a bag of holding no longer destroys the contents of the bag;
  instead they are scattered throughout the dungeon, as is the player.
* Polymorphing magical items now more reliably yields magical items.
* The Banes now warn of their respective monster classes, if they did not
  do so previously.
* Dragging a ball and chain around while underwater now causes them to
  rust away (as would happen if the ball was being carried).
* Two additional item properties have been added: hunger and aggravation.

There are some subtle changes that are not listed here.  You are encouraged
to explore the game to find some of them.
