Additional changes from NetHack 3.4.3
-------------------------------------
Interface-related:
* Most areas of the status line acquire colours when an important change
  happens, e.g. your attributes turn green if they've just increased
  or red if they've decreased.
* In the tty windowing system, areas of the map not in your current line of
  sight now take on a darker colour.
* Hallucination causes the entire map to take on strange colours (in tty
  GruntHack) and also distorts your perception of items.  Fortunately as
  it times out its effects are gradually reduced.

Dungeon-related:
* Gehennom has been remodelled - instead of a series of mazes, it is now
  a series of caverns complete with rivers of lava and hordes of demons.
* The Gnomish Mines contain pools of water and the occasional river.
* The Elemental Planes appear in random order in the end game.

Player-related:
* Optionally, players can play as a kobold, ogre, or giant, each of which
  brings unique problems due to their respective sizes.
* The arbitrary alignment restriction on elves has been removed; they
  can now play any alignment (and can play a few new roles as well).
* You can cast monster spells while polymorphed into a spell-casting form.
* Low dexterity causes fumbling on an intermittent basis.  Gauntlets of
  fumbling and fumble boots set dexterity to 6 as a consequence.
* Wearing greased gauntlets grants "slippery fingers" extrinsically.
* Attempting to abuse the astral call bug causes the gods to take notice.
* Death messages while immobile now reflect the reason for immobility.
* Death messages while stuck in creature form now reflect the method of
  death as opposed to plain "stuck in creature form".

Monster-related:
* Some classes of monster can have a race, much as the player does.  Some
  monsters have been merged as a result.  showrace now additionally
  shows the race of monsters as well as yourself.
* Shopkeepers that hate your race will charge extra.
* Monsters that polymorph will revert to original form if killed;
  their polymorph can also time out.
* Monsters can now use ranged weapons against other monsters, including
  polearms and monster spells.
* Monsters can use scrolls of remove curse.
* Intelligent pets will actively seek out better equipment to make use of.
* Monsters can use additional types of equipment that grant magical effects
  just as the player can.
* Monsters actively target your pets as well as you.
* The behaviour of covetous monsters has been improved. Most notably those
  not capable of teleporting can no longer teleport.  If they manage to
  acquire their desired target they will attempt to flee effectively.
* Monster displacement is implemented.  Shimmering dragons are re-enabled
  as a consequence.
* In addition to the shimmering dragons, the vampire mage and vorpal
  jabberwock are enabled.
* Kings are now guaranteed to appear in throne rooms.
* Pets will not eat if they are not hungry. Unintelligent pets can choke if
  you overfeed them; intelligent pets can keep food with them. 
* Gelatinous cubes and water elementals now have an engulfing attack,
  making them much more fearsome opponents.
* Puddings have their maximum HP halved when they divide.
* Puddings are now split with edged weapons as opposed to any iron object.
* Messages for monsters missing you are more verbose, explaining what
  piece of armour stopped the blow.

Object-related:
* Non-artifact objects can have additional properties (e.g. ___ of fire
  resistance).
* Object material is now determined on a per-object basis.
* Foobanes deal additional damaging effects to their targets.
* Hitting monsters with a wielded scroll or wand causes some of the
  object's magic to be released.  Throwing scrolls has a similar effect.
* Hitting a water elemental with a potion of acid causes the potion
  to explode.
* Potions of gain ability and wands now interact plausibly.
* Unidentified fake Amulets of Yendor cannot be put in containers.
